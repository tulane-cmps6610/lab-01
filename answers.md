- **4)** Describe the worst case input value of `key` for `linear_search`? for `binary_search`? 

- **5)** Describe the best case input value of `key` for `linear_search`? for `binary_search`? 

- **8)** Call `print_results(compare_search())` and paste the results here:

- **9)** Do the theoretical running times match your empirical results?

- **10a)** What is worst-case complexity of searching a list of $n$ elements $k$ times using linear search? 

- **10b)** For binary search? 

- **10c)** For what values of $k$ is it more efficient to first sort and then use binary search versus just using linear search without sorting? You may assume that your sorting algorithm runs in $O(n \lg n)$ time.
